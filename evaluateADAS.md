### How to? evaluate and validate an ADAS system

You now have a local simulation environment configured for the SCANeR SDK and you're ready to design your first SCANeR experimentation! 

Important: This guide explains how to design an experimentation to evaluate and validate an ADAS system
- Build a scenario
- Build a sensors' configuration
- Build a SCANeR program to connect your ADAS system to SCANeR I/O
- Evaluate and Validate your ADAS system

The example is going to be fairly simple, but you'll learn the fundamental steps for designing an experimentation and interface an ADAS system to SCANeR I/O.

If you get stuck at any point, you can compare your progress to our SAMPLE_2021_ADAS source configuration.
The tutorial is tested to work with the SCANeR Software 2021.1.
