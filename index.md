## Welcome to Samples-Pack Pages

You can use the Samples-Pack to avoid to start a new project with a white page or preview new content and features for your experimentations.

The Samples-Pack is about 30 SCANeR configurations ready to run experimentations showing some of the best practices. 
The key point is that the Samples-Pack help you to avoid to start a new project with a white page.
