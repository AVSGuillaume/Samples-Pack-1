## Welcome to Samples-Pack Pages

The Samples-Pack is about 30 SCANeR configurations ready to run experimentations showing some of the best practices.

The key points are that the Samples-Pack help you to avoid to start a new project with a white page or preview new SCANeR content and feature.

If you feel the need for a missing experimentation, let us know. We may have scenarios not yet included in the Samples-Pack that we could share or we may take your feedback into account for the next version of the Samples-Pack.
